# react-apps

This repo is simply for me re-learning the basics of React and actually implementing them.

1. Tutorial App: The offered basic tutorial on React's own homepage (link: https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)
2. Counter App: The more in-depth tutorial by Programming with Mosh (link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ke90Tje7VS0&t=3400s)
3. League: A simple page where I can combine my interests and try to learn React better.
